# ahkverifierdatabase
This is a simple database to store data for my AHK projects such as login data
All login data are safely hashed with salt. Your data is kept safe and you may request a data reset or data wipe whenever.

# The files
## HWIDS
This file contains the login details with proper cryptography for the algorithm to fetch from. 
This is manually updated for now, will be automatized later on.
## Modules
This file contains the names of the currently verified and registered modules for the module fetcher.
The script will only recognize modules that are stored in the database.
